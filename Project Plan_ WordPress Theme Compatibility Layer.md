Project Plan: WordPress Theme Compatibility Layer (WP-TCL)Date: November 2025Version: 1.2 (Revised for Functional MVP & Twenty Seventeen Triage)1. Project OverviewProject Goal: To create a backward compatibility layer that allows older themes developed for the Backdrop CMS (or a Drupal-like framework) to be rendered and function correctly within a modern WordPress environment. This will be achieved by intercepting calls to the legacy framework's PHP functions and template suggestions.Primary Benefit: Enables effortless migration and prolonged life for existing theme assets, drastically reducing the cost and effort of platform transition.Proof of Concept (PoC) Target: The initial PoC will focus on successfully running the WordPress Twenty Seventeen theme without modification on a system running Backdrop CMS version 1.30 (the version current at Drupal 7 End-of-Life). This specific target ensures alignment with the last fully Classic Editor-optimized WordPress theme.2. Scope of WorkThe project is focused on creating a targeted functional compatibility layer and a template redirection mechanism.2.1. Inclusions (What will be done)Twenty Seventeen Function Audit & Triage: A line-by-line analysis of the Twenty Seventeen theme to categorize every WordPress function it calls into "Critical" (must work for rendering), "Nice-to-Have" (can be stubbed initially), and "Irrelevant" (can be ignored/logged).Functional Loop Emulation: Implementation of the core WordPress Loop logic (have_posts, the_post, wp_reset_postdata) and the global $post object mapping to ensuring content iterates and displays correctly.Critical Template Tag Implementation: Functional implementation of essential display functions (e.g., the_title(), the_content(), get_header(), get_template_part()) to ensure they actually output data from the Backdrop system.Non-Critical Function Stubbing: Creation of logging stubs for functions identified as non-essential for the initial rendering (e.g., complex comment form logic or pingbacks) to prevent crashes without blocking the page load.Template Redirection/Interception: Mechanism to intercept the legacy framework's template suggestion process and redirect rendering to the appropriate WordPress template files.Configuration: A simple interface to enable/disable the layer and view logs.2.2. Exclusions (What will NOT be done)Re-implementing Complex Business Logic: We will not fully re-implement complex WP subsystems (e.g., the entire Widgets API or Customizer API) in Phase 1 unless critical for Twenty Seventeen's basic rendering.Full Feature Parity: The layer is designed for theme compatibility, not module compatibility. It will not support complex legacy module APIs or functions not typically used within a theme's template files.Support for Block Editor Themes: Scope is strictly limited to themes architecturally similar to Twenty Seventeen and earlier. Themes relying on the Gutenberg Block Editor (Twenty Nineteen and later) are explicitly excluded from this PoC scope.3. Key Phases and MilestonesThe project will be broken down into distinct phases, allowing for iterative testing.PhaseMilestone TitleKey ActivitiesDeliverableP1Foundation & TriageSet up module structure. Run the Function Audit on Twenty Seventeen. Categorize all identified functions. Define the logging utility.Plugin Skeleton & Triage Report (Critical vs. Stub List)P2Core Logic & LoopImplement the "Loop State Machine" in the module. Create the WP_Post_Mock class and map Backdrop Node fields to it. Implement have_posts() and the_post().Functional Loop Logic (Data appears in variables)P3Template Tag ImplementationImplement the "Critical" functions identified in P1 (e.g., get_header, the_title). Ensure they output the data setup in P2. Implement file loading for get_template_part.Library of Working Template TagsP4Integration & RenderingConnect the Backdrop theme rendering hook to the WP template files. Ensure header.php -> index.php -> footer.php flow works. Verify CSS/JS asset loading.Visual Success: Twenty Seventeen renders a node.P5RefinementAddress "Nice-to-Have" functions. Fix styling glitches. Ensure no PHP warnings are generated during normal browsing.Final Polished PoC4. Risks and MitigationsRiskDescriptionMitigation StrategyR1Loop Logic MismatchThe way WP handles the global $post state vs. Backdrop's node_view is complex.R2Critical Function MissingA "Nice-to-Have" function turns out to be critical for layout (e.g., a CSS class generator).R3Asset Loading PathsWP themes expect assets relative to their folder; Backdrop might serve them incorrectly.5. Key DeliverablesWP-TCL Module Package: The complete, runnable Backdrop module.Triage Report: A document listing every function in Twenty Seventeen and its implementation status.Bridge Theme: The Backdrop theme wrapping the Twenty Seventeen files.Installation Guide: Instructions for setting up the PoC on a Backdrop 1.30 site.This plan serves as the architectural foundation for the development of the WordPress Theme Compatibility Layer.
